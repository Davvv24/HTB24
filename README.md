# HTB25
Test github repo

# Instructions

1. Open photoshop, scale image to 5000x5000 and save to /images/"map_enlarged.jpg", then run files with title improve_acc.py.
2. Request conda environment from Maro, then run /test.py (do not run "run.py" as this a training file)
3. Run tester.py to compare images, you will need to overlap the classification map somehow before doing so, oh also provide your own google static maps api key please.
